For deployment instructions and guidance about best practices, see the article [DMZ between Azure and the Internet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz) on the Azure Architecture Center.

The deployment uses [Azure Building Blocks](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki) (azbb), a command line tool that simplifies deployment of Azure resources.
