# Enterprise BI with SQL Data Warehouse

This reference architecture implements an [ELT](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl#extract-load-and-transform-elt) (extract-load-transform) pipeline that moves data from an on-premises SQL Server database into SQL Data Warehouse and transforms the data for analysis.

For deployment instructions and guidance about best practices, see the article [Enterprise BI with SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/enterprise-bi-sqldw) on the Azure Architecture Center.

The deployment uses [Azure Building Blocks](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki) (azbb), a command line tool that simplifies deployment of Azure resources.
